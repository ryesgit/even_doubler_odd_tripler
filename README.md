# Even Doubler Odd Tripler (EDOT)
Takes in a file input, distinguishes odd from even, and then double or triple them.

1. Take a file input
2. Iterate through all the numbers from file input
    - If even, then double and append to even.txt file
    - If odd, then triple and append to odd.txt file
3. Remember to close the txt file! (Use with operator for a foolproof execution!)
